            The Bike for Brussels Route Planner is a{' '}
            <strong>route planning application for cyclists in Brussels</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Current navigation applications such as Google Maps usually donâ€™t take into account
            factors that are important for cyclists while planning a route. The Bike for Brussels
            Route Planner has a different approach: you can choose between different routes while
            planning: fast, balanced and relaxed. The relaxed route avoids cobblestones and big
            streets, and follows the cycle lanes in Brussels more often.
          </p>
          <p>
            This route planner uses OpenStreetMap and is closely{' '}
            <strong>related to the Road Completion project</strong>.
